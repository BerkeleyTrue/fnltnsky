# Fennel Format

Format your Fennel!

Note that this is somewhat of a work in progress and should not at
this point be considered authoritative on how to format Fennel code.

## Usage

    $ make # compile fnlfmt script you can place on your $PATH
    $ ./fnlfmt mycode.fnl # prints formatted code to standard out
    $ cat my-file.fnl | fnlfmt - # pipe fennel to stdin, get formatted stdout

## Contributing

Send patches directly to the maintainer or the
[Fennel mailing list](https://lists.sr.ht/%7Etechnomancy/fennel)

## Known issues

* The `{: symbol}` shorthand notation is not used.
* Strings are only ever emitted as `:colon-notation` in table keys.
