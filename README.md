# Fennel Format

Format your Fennel!

Note that this is somewhat of a work in progress and should not at
this point be considered authoritative on how to format Fennel code.
However, almost all of the current bugs involve comments, so using
the `--no-comments` flag produces reasonable (non-commented) results.

## Usage

    $ make # compile fnlfmt script you can place on your $PATH
    $ ./fnlfmt mycode.fnl # prints formatted code to standard out
    $ cat my-file.fnl | fnlfmt - # pipe fennel to stdin, get formatted stdout

You can skip reformatting of top-level forms by placing a comment
before them:

```fennel
(fn this-function [can be formatted ...]
  ...)

;; fnlfmt: skip
(local this-table ["benefits" :from
                   "different kind of" :FORMATTING])

(fn this-function [will-be]
  (formatted :normally "again"))
```

## Known issues

* Trailing comments at end of a line often get pushed down to the next line.
* One-line `if` and threading forms will always get turned into multi-line.
* When using fnlfmt programmatically, it may modify the AST argument.
